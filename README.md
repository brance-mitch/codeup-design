CSS(Bootstrap) -- CodeUp Design (viewport shift project) --

The project detailed a full usage of the Bootstrap library that we are currently working through. The object of this lesson is to identify proper usages of the pre-defined Bootstrap library to integrate into the developer user's styling. The library usage has a variation of xs-sm-md-lg-xl that is in accordance to the viewport viewability. The styling components consist of class lists whose attributive values may be added according to the media query window.

Today we started the project on codeup-design which allowed us to get a taste of CSS Bootstrap Library. The CodeUp design project is intended to test the group's ability in the viewport variation of the Library. We started the project from mobile up to desktop view. 
// Notes: we didn't get near as far as intended for looking over the nav bar too many times. The over-thought was in styling the nav from the media query positioning that occurs on viewport shift.

Today we continued working on codeup-design project and progressed a bit farther than mobile view. The media query shift from viewport got us right past mobile view.
// Notes: we were still not utilizing media query viewport to its full ability.
